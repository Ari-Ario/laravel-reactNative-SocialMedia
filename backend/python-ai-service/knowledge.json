None is the return value of functions that \"don't return anything\". It is also a common default return value for functions that search for something and may or may not find it; for example, it's returned by re.search when the regex doesn't match, or dict.get when the key has no entry in the dict. You cannot add None to strings or other objects.\nOne of your variables is None, not a string. Maybe you forgot to return in one of your functions, or maybe the user didn't provide a command-line option and optparse gave you None for that option's value. When you try to add None to a string, you get that exception:\nsend_command(child, SNMPGROUPCMD + group + V3PRIVCMD)\n\nOne of group or SNMPGROUPCMD or V3PRIVCMD has None as its value.\n",
